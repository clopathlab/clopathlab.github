        Professor Claudia Clopath is based in the Bioengineering Department at Imperial College London. She is heading the Computational Neuroscience Laboratory.


    </p>
    <p>
        Her research interests are in the field of neuroscience, especially insofar as it addresses the questions of
        learning and memory. She uses mathematical and computational tools to model synaptic plasticity, and to study
        its
        functional implications in artificial neural networks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prof. Clopath holds an MSc in Physics from the EPFL and did her PhD in Computer Science under Wulfram Gerstner.
        Before
        joining Imperial College, she did postdoctoral fellowships in neuroscience with Nicolas Brunel at Paris
        Descartes
        and in the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia University. She published highly cited articles in
        top
        journals such as Science and Nature, has given dozens of invited talks and keynotes around the world, and
        received
        various prizes such as the Google Faculty Award in 2015.

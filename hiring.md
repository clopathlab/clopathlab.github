We are constantly looking for outstanding Master students, PhD students, and Postdocs, interested in working in the field of computational neuroscience, and we welcome
spontaneous applications. 


## Requirements
The Computational Neuroscience Laboratory, headed by Prof. Claudia Clopath, is looking for talented Master, PhD students or Postdocs, interested in working in the field of computational 
neuroscience, specifically addressing questions of learning and memory. <!--The PhD position is fully funded, and will start in the autumn 2013 (date is flexible). -->
The 
perfect candidate has a strong mathematical, physical or engineering background (or equivalent), and a keen interest in biological and neural systems. Demonstrated 
programming skills are a plus. 


## Research topic

Learning and memory are among the most fascinating topic of neuroscience, yet our understanding of it is only at the beginning. 
Learning is thought to change the connections between the neurons in the brain, a process called synaptic plasticity. Using mathematical and computational tools, 
it is possible to model synaptic plasticity across different time scales, which helps understand how different types of memory are formed. The candidates will be 
working to build those models of synaptic plasticity, and study the functional role of synaptic plasticity in artificial neural networks. They will have the opportunity 
to collaborate with experimental laboratories, which study connectivity changes and behavioural learning.
	
	 
## The Lab
The Computational Neuroscience Laboratory is very young and dynamic, and publishes in prestigious journals, 
such as Nature and Science. It is part of the Department of Bioengineering, which conducts state-of-the-art multidisciplinary research in 
biomechanics, neuroscience and neurotechnology. The lab is at Imperial College London, the 3rd ranked university in Europe, and is located in the city centre of London.

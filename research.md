The lab is broadly interested in the field of neuroscience, especially insofar as it addresses the questions of 
**learning and memory**. Learning is thought to change the connections between the neurons in the brain,
 a process called synaptic plasticity. Using **mathematical** and **computational** tools, 
 we model **synaptic plasticity** across different time scales that reproduces experimental findings. 
 We then study the role of synaptic plasticity, by constructing **networks** of artificial neurons 
 with plastic synapses. We are working to tight collaboration with experimental laboratories, 
 which measure connectivity changes and behavioral learning. 

Below is a list of the research questions and projects of the lab: 

* We model **long-term plasticity** that reproduces slice experiments in a 
number of different systems (hippocampus, visual cortex, somatosensory cortex). 

* We model **very long-term plasticity** (memory over whole lifespans), 
which involves the mechanism of synapse consolidation.	

* We study the role of synaptic plasticity in **receptive field development** 
and in selectivity in the inputs.	In particular, we study the mechanism of 
how learning can develop orientation selectivity in visual cortex (using dynamical systems techniques)
 and perform blind source separation (e.g. demixing sounds at a cocktail party).	

* We study recurrent **artificial neural networks** with plastic synapses. In particular, 
we study the close relation between the type of coding and the type of connectivity 
found in different brain areas. Among others, we could explain the recently observed 
differences between the connectivity in visual cortex and in barrel cortex. 
The theoretical work predicted that neurons with similar receptive fields have 
a high probability of being reciprocally connected, a finding that was later confirmed experimentally. 

* We study the functional implication of **inhibitory plasticity**, a regulatory 
mechanism to keep balance between inhibition and excitation.

* Expanding to different brain areas, namely the **cerebellum**, we study how optimal 
memory capacity can predict synaptic weight distributions between Parallel Fibers 
and Purkinje Cells, using statistical physics methods.

* We develop phenomenological models of cerebellar learning, reproducing **learning 
behavior** of wild-type and knock-out mice, as well as Purkinje cell electrophysiological 
measurements before and after learning.
